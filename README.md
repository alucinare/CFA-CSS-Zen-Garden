# CFA-CSS-Zen-Garden

An exercise in class to change the style of another website solely by altering the properties of the CSS file. The HTML file is not to be altered in any way. This exercise draws on the resources from [CSS Zen Garden.](http://www.csszengarden.com/) 

## About the Site

This is the very first website that I pseudo created by manipulating the CSS file. I didn't really have much of an idea of what I was doing. It felt like I was contiually trying to change property values and see what they would do. Documentation helped some though it was good to see the change myself.

Eventually, I decided having a theme to work our would be helpful. I decided on a zen cat theme because cats and zen are both awesome. Then I started to play around with the positioning and eventually worked out how to get the site to its current form.

It took me the better part of the night after class to get it the way I, mostly, wanted it. The exercises made me aware of the challenges of positioning in CSS and the potential of styling that's available.
